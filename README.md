# 06 3D RPG
The 6th project for MSCH C220. An extremely simplistic 3D game.

# Description
An extremely simplistic 3D game. Score function was not working for an unknown reason but every other feature works properly. The music is made by me from scratch with some references to nintendo forest music. Could not get it to loop.
